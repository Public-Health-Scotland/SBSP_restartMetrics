# SBSP_restartMetrics

All NHS Scotland screening programmes were halted in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Scottish Breast Screening Programme resumed in early August 2020, working through a backlog of patients. The breast restart metrics are calculated monthly to review the numbers of appointments allocated and attended, as well as referrals, slippage, and waiting times for each of the six Scottish breast screening centres and the whole of Scotland for comparison to pre-pandemic levels.
